                                    The goal of the project is to develop a website similar to pastebin.com, which is a platform for users to upload and share snippets of text, such as code snippets or plain text. The website should have functionalities like user authentication, creating and managing pastebins, and viewing, editing, and deleting pastebins. The target audience includes developers, students, and other users who need to share text snippets. The design should be simple and easy to use, with a focus on functionality and usability.
